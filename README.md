# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
The aim of this project is to build a classifier model such that after feeding the features like gender, martial-status, number of dependents, applicant's income, co-applicant's income, Loan Amount, Loan Tenure etc, the model can predict in Yes/No whether the loan shall be approved or not.For this we are training the model with labelled data of Y/N.But before actually building the data i have followed the general convention i.e having a desciptive data exploration. Finding the missing entries, filling them with proper imputations and then finally fitting the training data into the model and finally, testing the accuracy score
